# üéØ Hybrid License System - Complete Guide

## ‚úÖ System Implemented Successfully!

Your ThymeSheet app now has an **automatic, one-time-use license key system** that:
- ‚úÖ Auto-assigns a unique key from a pool of 50 keys
- ‚úÖ Each key works on ONE computer only (hardware-bound)
- ‚úÖ No manual emailing needed
- ‚úÖ Works completely offline
- ‚úÖ Each installer can activate up to 50 users

---

## üîÑ How It Works

### User Experience:
```
1. User downloads ThymeSheet installer
2. Runs installer and installs app
3. Opens ThymeSheet for the first time
4. App automatically picks a random key from the pool
5. Key is instantly activated and tied to their computer
6. User never sees or enters a key - it just works!
```

### Behind the Scenes:
- 50 pre-generated license keys are embedded in `license-key-pool.json`
- On first launch, app checks if already licensed
- If not, randomly selects one key from the pool
- Activates that key (binds to MAC address + hostname + OS)
- License file saved to `Documents/ThymeSheet/.thymesheet-license`
- That key is now permanently tied to that computer

---

## üìÅ Files Created

### 1. **license-key-pool.json** (50 valid keys)
   - Embedded in every installer
   - Contains 50 cryptographically valid license keys
   - Randomly selected on first launch

### 2. **thymesheet-license-tracker.csv** (Your tracking spreadsheet)
   - Track which keys have been activated
   - See who is using each key
   - Monitor activation dates

### 3. **generate-secure-keys.js** (Key generator)
   - Generate MORE keys when you run out
   - Same mathematical algorithm
   - Unlimited key generation

---

## üöÄ Distribution Process

### Step 1: Build the Installer
```bash
npm run dist
```

This creates an installer in the `dist/` folder that includes:
- The app
- The 50-key pool
- Everything users need

### Step 2: Share the Installer
Upload `ThymeSheet Setup 2.0.2.exe` to:
- **Google Drive** (with public link)
- **Dropbox** (with public link)
- **Your website**
- **Email** (if small enough)
- **GitHub Releases** (best for updates)

### Step 3: Users Download & Install
- Users run the installer
- Install ThymeSheet
- Open the app
- Automatic activation - done!

## üìä Tracking Activations

Use the provided **thymesheet-license-tracker.csv** file to track usage:

| License Key              | Issued To | Email | Date Activated | Status | Hardware ID | Notes |
|-------------------------|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| THYME-DZND-FMGZ-8DD8    | User 1    | email | 2025-10-16     | Active | abc123...   |       |
| THYME-FNDH-T3ZF-79FC    | User 2    | email | 2025-10-16     | Active | def456...   |       |

**How to track:**
- Users can send you their activated key (optional)
- You can add a "report activation" feature (sends key to Google Form)
- Manually track based on who downloaded

## üîÑ When You Run Out of Keys

### Option A: Generate New Pool (Recommended)

1. Generate 50 more keys:
```bash
node generate-secure-keys.js 50
```

2. Update `license-key-pool.json` with new keys

3. Rebuild installer:
```bash
npm run dist
```

4. Upload new installer with new key pool

### Option B: Add Keys to Existing Pool

1. Generate additional keys:
```bash
node generate-secure-keys.js 25
```

2. Open `license-key-pool.json`

3. Add new keys to the array:
```json
{
  "keys": [
    "THYME-DZND-FMGZ-8DD8",
    "THYME-FNDH-T3ZF-79FC",
    ... (existing keys)
    "THYME-NEW1-KEY1-XXXX",  // Add new keys here
    "THYME-NEW2-KEY2-YYYY"
  ]
}
```

4. Rebuild and redistribute

## üîê Security Features

### Hardware Binding
Each key is tied to:
- MAC address (network adapter)
- Computer hostname
- Operating system

If someone tries to:
- **Share their install** ‚Üí New person gets a DIFFERENT random key
- **Copy their license file** ‚Üí Won't work on different hardware
- **Reinstall on same computer** ‚Üí Same key still works

### Key Validation
Keys are validated using cryptographic checksums:
- Format: `THYME-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ`
- `ZZZZ` is a checksum of `XXXX + YYYY + SECRET`
- Can't be faked without knowing your SECRET

### What if installer is shared?
- Each person who installs gets ONE random key from the pool
- Max 50 activations per installer build
- Generate new installer with new pool when needed

## üí∞ For Future: Transitioning to Paid

When you're ready to sell ThymeSheet:

### Option 1: Keep Current System
1. Use Gumroad/Paddle for sales
2. Generate unique key per purchase
3. Email key to customer (they enter manually)
4. Good for: Simple setup, low volume

### Option 2: Upgrade to Online Validation
1. Move keys to a database (Firebase/Supabase)
2. App requests key from your server
3. Track activations in real-time
4. Allow license transfer (revoke old, issue new)
5. Good for: Professional, scalable, support features

### Option 3: Subscription Model
1. Use Stripe/Paddle subscription
2. Validate active subscription via API
3. Monthly/yearly billing
4. Good for: Recurring revenue

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Each Installer = 50 Activations
- One installer can activate 50 different computers
- After 50, you need a new installer with fresh keys
- Track your distribution carefully!

### Keys Are Visible in Installer
- Technically, someone could open `license-key-pool.json` in the installer
- They would see all 50 keys
- **But**: Each key still only works on ONE computer
- **So**: Even if they see the keys, they can only use one
- **This is the trade-off** for offline, automatic activation

### More Secure Alternatives
If you need HIGHER security (for selling):
- Use Google Sheets backend (free, requires internet)
- Use Firebase (free tier, professional)
- Use paid service like Gumroad (handles everything)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- Check `thymesheet-license-tracker.csv`
- Track how many keys have been used
- Generate new installer when running low

### When Users Report Issues
Common issues:
1. **"License activation failed"**
   - Pool might be empty (all 50 used)
   - Generate new installer

2. **"Need to transfer to new computer"**
   - Generate a new key manually
   - Send via email
   - They enter it manually

3. **"Lost access after reinstall"**
   - Same hardware = should work automatically
   - Different hardware = need new key
