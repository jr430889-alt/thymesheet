# üöÄ License System Implementation Steps

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

- ‚úÖ Cryptographic license validation system created
- ‚úÖ 50 license keys generated in `license-key-pool.json`
- ‚úÖ App auto-selects and activates keys from pool
- ‚úÖ Hardware binding (one key per computer)
- ‚úÖ Key pool included in installer build

---

## üìã Next Steps to Go Live

### Step 1: Clean Up Test Environment

First, remove any existing test license:

```bash
# Delete the test license file if it exists
del "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\ThymeSheet\.thymesheet-license"
```

### Step 2: Test the License System

```bash
# Kill any running instances
tasklist /FI "IMAGENAME eq electron.exe" /NH
# If any found, kill them manually or restart computer

# Start fresh
npm start
```

**Expected behavior:**
1. App starts
2. Shows "Checking license..." briefly
3. Auto-activates with a random key from the pool
4. App loads normally

**Test it works:**
- Close the app
- Open again - should NOT ask for license (already activated)
- Check the license file was created:
  ```bash
  type "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\ThymeSheet\.thymesheet-license"
  ```

### Step 3: Update Version Number

Before building for distribution:

**Edit `package.json`:**
```json
{
  "version": "2.0.3",  // Change from 2.0.2 to 2.0.3
  ...
}
```

This signals to existing users that there's an update.

### Step 4: Build the Installer

```bash
npm run dist
```

This creates:
- `dist/ThymeSheet Setup 2.0.3.exe` (installer with 50-key pool)

### Step 5: Test on Another Computer (Optional but Recommended)

If you have access to another Windows computer:
1. Copy `ThymeSheet Setup 2.0.3.exe` to it
2. Install
3. Open app
4. Verify auto-activation works
5. Close and reopen - verify license persists

### Step 6: Upload for Distribution

Upload `ThymeSheet Setup 2.0.3.exe` to:
- **Google Drive** (create shareable link)
- **Dropbox** (create shareable link)
- **Your website** (if you have one)
- **GitHub Releases** (recommended for auto-update)

## üë• Handling Existing Users

You have existing users on v2.0.2 or earlier (no license). Here are your options:

### Option A: Auto-Activate for Everyone (Recommended - Easiest)

**What happens:**
- Existing users get update notification
- They update to v2.0.3
- App auto-activates from the pool
- ‚úÖ Seamless for users
- ‚ùå Uses one key per existing user

**Implementation:**
- Do nothing special - it's already set up!
- Just distribute v2.0.3

### Option B: Pre-Assign Keys to Known Users

**What happens:**
- Email existing users BEFORE releasing v2.0.3
- Give them their key in advance
- They manually enter it when prompted

**Email template:**
```
Subject: ThymeSheet Update - License Key Required

Hi [Name],

ThymeSheet v2.0.3 includes a new licensing system.

Your personal license key is:
THYME-XXXX-YYYY-ZZZZ

When you update, the app will automatically activate. If prompted for a key, enter the one above.

This doesn't change how the app works - just adds license protection.

Download the update here: [link]

Thanks!
```

**Implementation:**
1. Generate 50 keys (already done in `license-key-pool.json`)
2. Manually assign first X keys to existing users
3. Email them their keys
4. Keep next (50 - X) keys for new users

### Option C: Grace Period (Most Flexible)

Add a temporary bypass for existing users.

**Edit `Jeremy-Time-Tracker.html` - add this before license check:**

```javascript
// Grace period: Skip license check until specific date
const GRACE_PERIOD_END = new Date('2025-11-01'); // Set your date
const isGracePeriod = new Date() < GRACE_PERIOD_END;

if (isGracePeriod) {
    setIsLicensed(true);
    setCheckingLicense(false);
    return;
}
```

This gives existing users time to get organized.

## üéØ My Recommendation

**Use Option A: Auto-Activate for Everyone**

Why:
- ‚úÖ Zero friction for users
- ‚úÖ No emails needed
- ‚úÖ Completely automatic
- ‚úÖ Professional user experience
- ‚úÖ You have 50 keys - likely enough

**How many existing users do you have?**
- If < 50: Auto-activate is perfect
- If > 50: You'll need to generate more keys anyway

---

## üìä Tracking Activations

Open `thymesheet-license-tracker.csv` and update as users activate:

```csv
License Key,User,Email,Date Activated,Status,Notes
THYME-DZND-FMGZ-8DD8,John Smith,john@email.com,2025-10-16,Active,Existing user
THYME-FNDH-T3ZF-79FC,Jane Doe,jane@email.com,2025-10-16,Active,New user
```

**How to know which keys are used:**
- Users can optionally email you their activated key
- Or add a "report activation" feature later
- Or just track by who downloaded

---

## üîÑ When You Need More Keys

After 50 activations:

```bash
# Generate 50 more keys
node generate-secure-keys.js 50

# Manually update license-key-pool.json with new keys

# Build new installer
npm run dist

# Now you have v2.0.4 with 50 fresh keys
```

---

## üì¶ Final Checklist

Before distributing v2.0.3:

- [ ] Delete test license file
- [ ] Test auto-activation works locally
- [ ] Update version to 2.0.3 in `package.json`
- [ ] Run `npm run dist`
- [ ] Verify `license-key-pool.json` is included in build
- [ ] (Optional) Test on another computer
- [ ] Upload installer to distribution platform
- [ ] Share download link with users
- [ ] Update tracking spreadsheet as users activate

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### "License activation failed"
- Pool might be empty (all 50 used)
- Generate new installer with fresh keys

### User says "It keeps asking for a license"
- Their license file might be corrupted
- Send them a key manually
- They enter it in the license screen

### "Update available" doesn't show for existing users
- Make sure version in package.json is higher than their current version
- Check GitHub release is published with correct tag

### Can't test because already activated locally
```bash
# Delete your license file
del "%USERPROFILE%\Documents\ThymeSheet\.thymesheet-license"

# Start app fresh
npm start
```

## üéâ You're Ready!

Follow the steps above and your license system will be live. Start with Step 1 and work through each step.

**Questions to answer:**
1. How many existing users do you have?
2. Do you want auto-activation for everyone? (recommended)
3. When do you want to release v2.0.3?

Once you answer these, you're ready to build and distribute!
