                      ThymeSheet Time Tracking Software
================================================================================

Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: November 26, 2025

================================================================================
INSTALLATION & SETUP
================================================================================

Q1: How do I install ThymeSheet?
A: Download the ThymeSheet-Setup installer from the official download location,
   run the installer, and follow the on-screen instructions. The installation
   process takes less than a minute.

Q2: Do I need administrator rights to install ThymeSheet?
A: No, ThymeSheet installs to your user directory and does not require
   administrator privileges.

Q3: What operating systems does ThymeSheet support?
A: ThymeSheet currently supports Windows 10 and Windows 11 (64-bit).

Q4: Why does Windows show a security warning when I run the installer?
A: This is normal for applications that are not code-signed with an expensive
   certificate. ThymeSheet is safe to install. Click "More info" and then
   "Run anyway" to proceed with installation.

Q5: How much disk space does ThymeSheet require?
A: ThymeSheet requires approximately 150MB of disk space for the application.
   Your time tracking data files are very small (typically a few KB to a few MB
   depending on usage).

================================================================================
LICENSE ACTIVATION
================================================================================

Q6: How do I activate my license?
A: When you first launch ThymeSheet, it will automatically activate using an
   embedded license key. Alternatively, if provided a license key separately,
   you can enter it in the activation dialog.

Q7: Do I need an internet connection to activate?
A: No, ThymeSheet activation works completely offline. No internet connection
   is required.

Q8: Can I use my license on multiple computers?
A: No. Each license is permanently bound to a single computer and cannot be
   transferred, shared, or used on multiple devices. You would need a separate
   license for each computer.

Q9: What happens if I reinstall ThymeSheet on the same computer?
A: Your license will automatically reactivate on the same computer. Your time
   tracking data is also preserved during reinstallation.

Q10: I'm getting a new computer. Can I transfer my license?
A: Licenses are non-transferable. If you're replacing your computer, you'll
   need a new license key for the new computer. Contact support for assistance
   in exceptional circumstances.

Q11: What if I upgrade my computer's hardware?
A: Minor hardware changes (RAM, hard drive) typically won't affect your
   license. Major changes (motherboard, network adapter) may require a new
   license key. Contact support if you experience activation issues after
   hardware changes.

   add a comment, and click the "Start" button (or press Enter). The timer will
   begin counting immediately.

Q13: Can I track time for multiple projects simultaneously?
A: No, you can only track time for one project at a time. However, you can
   quickly switch between projects by stopping the current timer and starting
   a new one.

Q14: Can I edit time entries after I've stopped the timer?
A: Yes! In the Recent Time Entries section, click the edit icon (pencil) next
   to any entry to modify the start time, end time, project, or comments.

Q15: Can I manually add time entries for work I forgot to track?
A: Yes, use the "Add Manual Time Entry" feature in the Track Time section to
   add entries with custom start and end times.

   Entries list. You'll be asked to confirm the deletion.

================================================================================
PROJECTS & DATA MANAGEMENT
================================================================================

Q17: How do I add projects to ThymeSheet?
A: Go to the "Manage Projects" tab. You can either:
   - Add projects manually using the "Add a project" form
   - Import multiple projects from a CSV file
   - Load demo data to try out the application

Q18: Can I import my existing project list?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet supports CSV import. Prepare a CSV file with columns:
   Client Name, Project/Admin Name, Task Code, Subtask Code. Then use the
   "Import Projects from CSV" feature.

Q19: Can I organize projects by client?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet uses a hierarchical structure: Client > Project > Task >
   Subtask. You can filter and search by any of these levels.

Q20: How do I export my time entries for billing?
A: Go to "Manage Projects" and click "Export Time to CSV". You can export all
   entries or filter by date range. The exported CSV file can be opened in
   Excel or any spreadsheet application.

Q21: What format is the exported data?
A: Data is exported as CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format, which can be opened
   in Excel, Google Sheets, or any spreadsheet application. The export includes
   client name, project, task, start time, end time, duration, and comments.

================================================================================
DATA STORAGE & PRIVACY
================================================================================

Q22: Where is my data stored?
A: All your time tracking data is stored locally on your computer in your
   operating system's standard user documents folder. The exact location
   depends on your OS, but is typically in a "ThymeSheet" folder.

Q23: Is my data sent to any servers or cloud services?
A: No. ThymeSheet operates completely offline. Your time tracking data never
   leaves your computer. The only network activity is optional update checking.

Q24: Does ThymeSheet collect any personal information?
A: No. ThymeSheet does not collect your name, email, usage statistics, or any
   personal information. The only data collected is hardware identifiers for
   license activation (stored locally on your computer).

Q25: How do I backup my time tracking data?
A: You are responsible for backing up your data. We recommend:
   - Regularly export your time entries to CSV
   - Include your ThymeSheet data folder in your regular backup routine
   - Copy the data files to a secure location or cloud storage of your choice

Q26: What happens to my data if I uninstall ThymeSheet?
A: Uninstalling ThymeSheet does NOT automatically delete your data. Your time
   tracking data remains in the data folder and can be recovered if you
   reinstall. To completely remove all data, you must manually delete the
   data folder after uninstalling.

Q27: Can I use ThymeSheet completely offline?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet is designed to work 100% offline. The only optional online
   feature is checking for software updates, which you can disable.

================================================================================
UPDATES & SUPPORT
================================================================================

Q28: How do I check for updates?
A: Go to Help > Check for Updates in the menu bar. ThymeSheet will check if a
   newer version is available and guide you through the update process if one
   exists.

Q29: Are updates automatic?
A: No. ThymeSheet does not automatically download or install updates. You have
   full control over when and if you update. This respects your system security
   preferences.

Q30: Will updating ThymeSheet delete my data?
A: No. Your time tracking data is stored separately from the application and is
   preserved across all updates.

Q31: Do I need to pay for updates?
A: Minor updates and bug fixes are free. Major version upgrades may require a
   new license or additional fee, but this will be clearly communicated.

A: You can:
   - Use the in-app Feedback button (Help menu)
   - Email support at [YOUR_SUPPORT_EMAIL]
   - Report issues on GitHub: https://github.com/jr430889-alt/thymesheet/issues

Q33: What kind of support is provided?
A: Support is provided on a best-effort basis via email and GitHub. We aim to
   respond to all inquiries but cannot guarantee response times or resolution
   of all issues.

================================================================================
FEATURES & FUNCTIONALITY
================================================================================

Q34: Can I set time rounding rules?
A: Yes! Go to Settings and configure time rounding options (e.g., round to
   nearest 15 minutes, 6 minutes for legal billing, etc.).

Q35: Does ThymeSheet have idle detection?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet can detect when you've been away from your computer and
   prompt you to decide whether to keep or discard the idle time.

Q36: Can I set a daily work hour goal?
A: Yes! In Settings, you can set a daily goal (e.g., 8 hours) and ThymeSheet
   will show your progress throughout the day.

Q37: Are there keyboard shortcuts?
A: Yes! Common shortcuts include:
   - Ctrl+Shift+Z: Show/Hide window
   - Ctrl+Shift+Space: Start/Stop timer
   - Enter: Start tracking selected project
   - Space: Pause/Resume timer
   - 1-9: Quick select recent projects

Q38: Can I minimize ThymeSheet to the system tray?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet minimizes to the system tray (notification area) when you
   close the window. Right-click the tray icon to access quick actions or
   double-click to restore the window.

Q39: Can I have the timer visible while working in other applications?
A: Yes! Enable the "Floating Timer" feature in Settings to display a small
   timer window that stays on top of other applications.

Q40: Can I track break times or non-billable activities?
A: Yes! Simply create projects for breaks or non-billable activities (e.g.,
   "Break - Lunch", "Admin - Email") and track time against them. You can
   filter these out when exporting for billing.

================================================================================
BILLING & PROFESSIONAL USE
================================================================================

Q41: Can I use ThymeSheet for billable client work?
A: Yes! ThymeSheet is designed for consultants and professionals tracking
   billable hours. However, you are responsible for verifying the accuracy of
   all time entries before billing clients.

Q42: Is the time tracking data accurate enough for billing?
A: ThymeSheet tracks time accurately, but like any time tracking tool, you
   should review entries before submitting invoices. The software does not
   guarantee 100% accuracy and you are responsible for verifying all data.

Q43: Can I track time for multiple clients?
A: Yes! The hierarchical structure (Client > Project > Task > Subtask) is
   specifically designed for managing multiple clients and projects.

Q44: Can I generate invoices with ThymeSheet?
A: ThymeSheet exports time data to CSV format which can be imported into
   invoicing software or used to manually create invoices. ThymeSheet itself
   does not generate invoices.

Q45: What happens if there's an error in my time tracking that affects client
     billing?
A: You are solely responsible for the accuracy of your billing. Always review
   exported time entries before submitting to clients. ThymeSheet's license
   agreement limits liability for billing errors.

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

Q46: ThymeSheet won't start. What should I do?
A: Try these steps:
   1. Restart your computer
   2. Reinstall ThymeSheet
   3. Check if antivirus software is blocking the application
   4. Contact support with details about any error messages

Q47: My time entries disappeared. How do I recover them?
A: Time entries are stored locally. Check if:
   1. You're looking at the correct date range (use the filter)
   2. Your data file wasn't accidentally deleted
   3. You have a backup of your data folder
   If data is lost and you have no backup, it cannot be recovered.

Q48: The timer keeps running even when I'm away. What's wrong?
A: Check your "Auto-Pause Detection" settings. You can configure ThymeSheet to
   detect idle time and prompt you to discard it.

Q49: I can't find my exported CSV file. Where did it go?
A: When you export, you choose the save location. Check your Downloads folder
   or the location you selected during export. The default filename includes
   the date.

Q50: Can I merge duplicate time entries?
A: ThymeSheet does not have an automatic merge feature. You would need to
   manually delete duplicates and create a new consolidated entry.

================================================================================
ADVANCED QUESTIONS
================================================================================

Q51: Can I sync ThymeSheet data across multiple computers?
A: No, ThymeSheet does not include built-in sync functionality. Each license
   works on one computer only. However, you can manually export/import data
   between computers if needed (though this would require separate licenses
   for each computer).

Q52: Can I customize the application interface or theme?
A: The current version uses a fixed professional interface. Customization
   options may be added in future updates.

Q53: Does ThymeSheet integrate with other tools (Jira, Asana, etc.)?

   export data to CSV and import it into other tools that support CSV import.

Q54: Can I run ThymeSheet from a USB drive (portable version)?
A: The current version is designed for standard installation. A portable
   version may be considered for future releases.

Q55: Is there a mobile version of ThymeSheet?
A: Not currently. ThymeSheet is a desktop application for Windows. Mobile
   versions may be considered for future development.
