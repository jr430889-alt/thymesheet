# Automatic License Key Distribution System

You want users to download the app and automatically get a unique, one-time-use license key. Here are your options:

## 🎯 Option 1: Simple File-Based System (FREE, No Server)

### How It Works:
1. Pre-generate 100+ license keys
2. Store them in a JSON file included with the installer
3. App picks the first unused key from the pool
4. Marks it as used by reporting back to a Google Form/Sheet

### Pros:
- ✅ Completely free
- ✅ No server needed
- ✅ Works offline for users

### Cons:
- ❌ Keys are technically visible in the installer
- ❌ If someone shares the installer, others can see unused keys
- ❌ Not truly secure for selling

### Implementation:
I can set this up in 10 minutes - each installer comes with a pool of keys and auto-assigns one.

## 🌟 Option 2: Google Sheets as Backend (FREE, Recommended)

### How It Works:
1. Store unused keys in a private Google Sheet
2. Create a Google Apps Script API
3. When user opens app, it requests a key from your Sheet
4. Sheet returns one unused key and marks it as used
5. Key is permanently tied to that user's computer

### Pros:
- ✅ Completely free (Google Sheets API)
- ✅ Keys never visible in installer
- ✅ Real-time tracking in spreadsheet
- ✅ You see who activates when
- ✅ Can generate more keys anytime

### Cons:
- ❌ Requires internet connection on first launch
- ❌ Requires 15 minutes of Google Apps Script setup

### Setup Required:
1. Create a Google Sheet with your keys
2. Write a simple Apps Script (I'll provide the code)
3. Deploy as web app
4. App calls your script to get a key

## 🚀 Option 3: Firebase (FREE Tier, Most Professional)

### How It Works:
1. Store keys in Firebase Realtime Database
2. App requests a key via Firebase SDK
3. Firebase automatically returns one unused key
4. Marks it as used immediately (atomic operation)

### Pros:
- ✅ Free tier (50GB bandwidth, 1GB storage)
- ✅ Very secure and professional
- ✅ Real-time tracking dashboard
- ✅ Built-in authentication
- ✅ Scales to thousands of users

### Cons:
- ❌ Requires Firebase account setup (10 min)
- ❌ Requires internet on first launch
- ❌ Need to learn basic Firebase

## 💰 Option 4: Gumroad/Paddle (Paid Platform)

### How It Works:
1. List ThymeSheet on Gumroad ($0 to list, 10% fee on sales)
2. Users "purchase" for $0 or paid price
3. Gumroad auto-generates and emails unique license key
4. You provide the key generation webhook

### Pros:
- ✅ Professional sales platform
- ✅ Handles payments when you're ready to sell
- ✅ Auto-generates keys per purchase
- ✅ Email delivery built-in
- ✅ Customer management

### Cons:
- ❌ 10% fee when selling
- ❌ Requires Gumroad account
- ❌ Users must "purchase" (even if free)

## 📊 My Recommendation for You

Based on your needs (automatic, no emailing, one-time use), I recommend:

### **Option 2: Google Sheets Backend** (Best balance)

**Why:**
- Free forever
- You control everything
- Simple spreadsheet tracking
- Keys auto-distributed
- One-time use guaranteed

**Setup Time:** 20 minutes

Would you like me to implement Option 2 (Google Sheets)?

Here's what I'll create:
1. ✅ Google Sheets template with your keys
2. ✅ Apps Script code (copy-paste into Google Sheets)
3. ✅ Updated app code to request keys from your sheet
4. ✅ Step-by-step setup instructions

The flow will be:
```
User downloads installer → Installs app → Opens app →
App contacts your Google Sheet → Sheet returns unused key →
Key auto-activates → Sheet marks key as used
```

## 🎁 Alternative: Hybrid Approach

If you want to avoid requiring internet connection:

### **Embedded Key Pool + Google Tracking**

1. App comes with 20 pre-generated keys embedded
2. On first launch, app picks one key randomly
3. Activates that key (ties to hardware)
4. Optionally reports to Google Sheet (if online)

**Pros:**
- Works offline
- Keys distributed automatically
- Still tracked in spreadsheet

**Cons:**
- If someone shares the installer, they share all 20 keys
- Not ideal for selling (but fine for free distribution)
